        <!-- OVERVIEW -->
        <div class="text">
            <br>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>As the <strong>solo designer and developer</strong>, I created an <strong>end-to-end server-side web application</strong> that allows users to <strong>browse, search, and filter</strong> a library of recipes. This project was part of my course, IDM232, which focused on equipping students with the skills to develop <strong>secure, dynamic, and data-driven web applications</strong>. From handling <strong>user input</strong> to <strong>database management</strong> and building <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>, I applied <strong>foundational web development principles</strong> and best practices throughout the process.</p>

        <!-- CONTEXT AND CHALLENGE -->
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
            <p>I aimed to deepen my understanding of server-side programming to build robust, data-driven websites â€“ not just design them. This course allowed me to expand my skills beyond front-end design and focus on developing secure, scalable server-side applications. The primary challenge was effectively integrating user input handling and database interactions into a cohesive and fully functional application.</p>

        <!-- PROCESS AND INSIGHT -->
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>

            <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
            <p>I used PHP for server-side scripting, MySQL for database management, and CSS for a responsive and accessible user experience.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Design and Architecture:</h3>
            <p>I began by designing a simple, user-friendly interface for the recipe library. The application allowed users to view recipes, search through them by ingredients or categories, and filter results based on various criteria. On the back end, I implemented structured code with proper error handling, modularity, and security practices.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>I researched best practices for building secure, scalable web applications. I explored how to effectively connect front-end and back-end technologies, ensuring smooth data flow and responsiveness. I also reviewed existing online recipe platforms to understand user expectations and features to include in my project.</p>

            <h2>Challenge and Solution</h2>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p> I encountered issues with database connectivity and learned how to handle errors effectively. Ensuring the front-end and back-end worked seamlessly together also required careful planning.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>I used a combination of research, online resources, and trial and error to overcome challenges. By incorporating security best practices and using prepared statements, I protected the database from SQL injection attacks. Error handling was implemented to ensure the application remained stable and user-friendly.
            </p>

        <!-- THE RESULTS -->
        <div class="text">
            <h2>The Results</h2>
            <p>The final product was a fully functional online cookbook that allowed users to interact with a large recipe database. I was able to implement all the required features: handling user input securely, connecting to a MySQL database, managing authentication, and building a RESTful API. The web application was stable, secure, and offered a smooth user experience.
